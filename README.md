You need to be familiar with basic concepts and features of Apigee Edge such as API Proxies, API Products and environments. For more information, refer to the [Apigee Edge Docs](http://docs.apigee.com).

You should be aware of the [Monetization concepts](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/monetization/basics-monetization) within Apigee Edge.

# Commands


## kickstart

Deploys a chain of entities for a ready-to-use sample configuration. This command makes use of the `/config` directory where all YML files reside.
If you are familiar with the monetization settings, you can edit all configuration files.

*Recommendation:* Keep the versioning tags in the entity names & IDs to increment in case of a failed execution.

### Examples

Executes kickstart configuration for specified organization and environment, considering existing settings ([What does that mean?](#Parameters))

```./mint kickstart -u user@domain.com -o my-nonprod -e test -l info -c true```

Executes kickstart configuration for specified organization and environment, overwriting/ignoring existing settings 

```./mint kickstart -u user@domain.com -o my-nonprod -e test -l info -c false```


### Parameters

**```--considerExistingSettings -c```**

(optional, `true/false`, default: `true`)
As the kickstart command modifies a range of settings from the _organization profile_ over to _currencies_ and _T&Cs_, you can choose to (a) overwrite all settings or (b) keep them and add the proxy, product and bundle to your existing configuration.

Choose `false` if you run this command on a clean/empty environment, choose `true` if you have already run this command before or if you would like to keep your existing org settings. **Please be aware** that config file changes might be necessary in order for the kickstart setup to work (e.g. clash of supported currencies and necessary changes to the organization profile).

#### Details

In more detail, the `-c false` flag executed two additional steps:
1. Checks whether the currency specified in `1-orgProfile.yml` is already available. If `true`, no new currency is being added
2. Checks whether there are existing T&Cs which have not expired yet. If `true`, no new T&Cs are added.

### Steps (TBD)

download repo
cd /somewhere

set env variables
username, password, org, loglevel
